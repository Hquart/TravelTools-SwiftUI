# Baluchon2

## Description

* Baluchon2 is an iOS iphone app realized in SwiftUI as part of my final project as a student in OpenClassRooms.
* The concept is a swiss knife for a french traveller. It features:
  * Destination choice (6 options)
  * Weather comparison between Paris and destination
  * Currency conversion 
  * Translation 

## Motivation

* This app was first realized with UIKit as an OpenClassRooms project
* The present version "Baluchon2" is a clone realized with swiftUI for the purpose of learning and discovering SwiftUI.
